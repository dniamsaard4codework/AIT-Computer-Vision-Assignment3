    "**Dataset**:\n",
    "- Use a subset of Pascal VOC, COCO, or a small custom dataset (10–20 images for quick runs).\n",
    "- Split into train/test.\n",
    "- Preprocess (resize, normalize, and convert masks to class indices).\n",
    "**Model Implementation**:\n",
    "- Implement FCN-32s, FCN-16s, or FCN-8s variants.\n",
    "- Use pretrained ResNet/VGG (remove final FC layers) as a backbone\n",
    "- Upsampling Method: 1) transpose convolution vs 2) bilinear interpolation.\n",
    "**Training**\n",
    "- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss\n",
    "- Optimizer: Adam or SGD\n",
    "- Metrics: Mean IoU, pixel accuracy\n",
    "- Train for 20 epochs (or until convergence).\n",
    "- Log training curves.\n",

    "- Jupyter notebook with clear code and comments.\n",
    "- Visualization of segmentation results (min. 3 test images).\n",
    "- Table comparing transpose convolution vs bilinear interpolation.\n",
    "- Summarize with visuals and short analysis."
